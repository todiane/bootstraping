# bootstraping

A place I use to create different bootstrap templates I might use on my projects. They all use Bootstrap 5 and when I find myself with some time on my hands and/or I want to get away from backend and play with a little front-end, I go through bootstrap and see what I can make.


They are all 100% mobile-first, fully responsive sections and I can pick and choose from any of them and put them together to create different looks.

# For example

## Template 4 has large images

![template 4](static/images/template4.webp)


## Template 3 has images and text

![template 3](static/images/template3.webp)

## Template 2 shows three images

This uses a modal. When you click on an image it shows up and you can link to a project or product

## Index
The index page has a full page template and is one I used on [Pen and I Publishing](https://www.penandipublishing.com/)
